# Luma Developer Assessment
Welcome to the Luma Developer Assessment. Congrats on getting this far! We are looking forward to seeing and talking through your submission.

## Assignment
Create a Rest API that allows authorized requesters to perform CRUD operations on the users in the provided database. You must create endpoints with the following functionality:
- List users
- Retrieve user by id
- Create user
- Update user
- Delete user

Each endpoint has been stubbed out in [app.js](./app.js). Your objective is to finish building each of the endpoints according to the criteria in the comments. There are 26 unit tests that will assess whether or not they are built to specification. You can receive partial credit, so please make sure you submit even if it is incomplete! If you are submitting incomplete work, comments describing your thought process are encouraged.

While developing, please use any tools that you would normally use to test your API (i.e. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)). Before [submitting](#Submitting-The-Assessment), please look at the [criteria](#criteria) to make sure your assessment is in the best possible shape.
